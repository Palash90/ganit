# Ganit
An open source Multi-Platform Multi-Language Programming Language/Library for Calculation Utility. The implementation is planned to be using an extended [Shunting Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) algorithm. The language supports very basic features and mostly focused on Mathematics and especially Macine Learning.

## The Plan

This is a project which is in planning phase and all the required publishing channels have been created. The main moto of this project is to create a Programming Language. The language will also be ported to many languages as library. This will facilitate any developer to work with mathematical expressions. This is lightweight and will have a limilted set of features as compared to Matlab, Wolfram, GNU Octave etc.

The language is planned to be ported to the following languages as libraries -

1. dotnet
1. JavaScript
1. python
1. Java
1. Rust
1. C
1. Shell Script
1. dos
