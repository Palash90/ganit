# Ganit
Ganit(गणित) means calculation in Sanskrit. As the name suggests, this is a Multi-Platform Multi-Language Programming Language Implementation/Library for Calculation Utility. The implementation is planned to be using an extended [Shunting Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) algorithm. The language supports very basic features and mostly focused on Mathematics and especially Machine Learning. Nothing fancy, not performant. This is just here to prove that things work and makes my understanding of the computer system concrete.

Computers can perform only calculations (or Ganit), even the state of the art Machine Learning algorithms are nothing but a very high level of mathematics. Hence the name - गणित

## The Plan

This is a project which is in planning phase and all the required publishing channels have been created. The main moto of this project is to create a Programming Language. The language will also be ported to many languages as library. This will facilitate any developer to work with mathematical expressions. This is lightweight and will have a limilted set of features as compared to Matlab, Wolfram, GNU Octave etc.

The language is planned to be ported to the following languages as libraries -
