# Ganit
An open source Multi-Platform Multi-Language support Programming Language/Library for Calculation Utility. The implementation is planned to be using [Split and Merge](https://github.com/vassilych/cscs) algorithm.

## The Plan

This is a project which is in planning phase and all the required publishing channels have been created. The main moto of this project is to create a Programming Language. The language will also be ported to many languages as library. This will facilitate any developer to work with mathematical expressions. This is lightweight and will have a limilted set of features as compared to Matlab, Wolfram, GNU Octave etc.

The language is planned to be ported to the following languages as libraries -

1. dotnet
1. JavaScript
1. python
1. Java
1. Rust
1. C
1. Shell Script
1. dos
